            I am a software engineer who takes a creative and analytical approach to technical problems. At home both digging through code and working with collaborators, I thrive in many different types of environments. My passion for tackling complex challenges inspired the hundreds of hours spent independently contributing to open source software.<br><br>

            My skills include JavaScript, Java, and Python, as well as associated frameworks. In addition to completing a software engineering bootcamp at General Assembly, I have made multiple open source project contributions and built others from scratch. I also have experience with a variety of data science and machine learning algorithms.

          <p class="description">An online version of the classic code-breaking game. The game was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. In the game, the player guesses at a randomly chosen secret color code until he/she either is correct, and wins, or makes 12 guesses, and loses. During each turn, the player receives feedback on how similar the guess was to the secret code.

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p>From this project, I learned how to write mathematical algorithms in JavaScript to compare code guesses with the secret code. I also learned to manipuate state with jQuery and use CSS to create a game board displaying the correct colors.</p>
